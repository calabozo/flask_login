# flask_login
Flask Login example

This is just a very basic Flask application that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) with [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for basic authentication and [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.x/) for forms.
